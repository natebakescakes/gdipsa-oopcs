GDipSA: Objected Oriented Programming in C#

This repository contains a Visual Studio solution with namespaces for each day of the Object Oriented Programming in C# (OOPCS) course for the Graduate Diploma in Systems Analysis.

---

The solution has 2 main types of projects:

1. `oopcs.Dayx` where `x == dayNo`
2. `oopcs.tests` which contains test classes for all unit tests for each day.

---

Within each main `oopcs.Dayx` project there are the following classes:

1. `Program.cs`
    - Main program file that handles the execution of each question/program
    - All methods are commented out except the method to be debugged
2. `Lecture.cs`
    - Program examples gone through during the lecture
3. `Workshop.cs`
    - Classes for each section of questions provided in the workshop questions.
4. `Quiz.cs`
    - The following day's quiz for the current day's worth of content
